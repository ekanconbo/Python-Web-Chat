Run chat_server.py, then run as many applications of chat_client.py as you like.

Commands:

/view
/set username [username]
/block [username]
/unblock [username]
/help
/logout

Non-functional components:

Be careful of escaping from the chat_client window with ctrl-C. it may stop the chat_server from functioning. /logout is fine.
